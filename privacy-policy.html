            At GentleCloud, we take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy
            explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info__subtitle">Information We Collect</h2>
          <p class="info__description">
            We collect information you provide directly to us when you use our services. This may include personal
            information such as your name, email address, and payment information. We may also collect information
            automatically when you interact with our services, such as your IP address and device information.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info__subtitle">How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p class="info__description">
            We may use the information we collect for various purposes, including to provide and improve our services,
            to communicate with you, to process transactions, and to personalize your experience. We may also use your
            information to comply with legal obligations and protect our rights.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info__subtitle">Information Sharing</h2>
          <p class="info__description">
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties without your
            consent, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share your information with service providers
            who assist us in operating our website and conducting our business.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info__subtitle">Data Security</h2>
          <p class="info__description">
            We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
            disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure,
            so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
          <h2 class="info__subtitle">Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p class="info__description">
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the
            revised policy will become effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy
            Policy periodically for any updates.
